# COIG-CQIAÔºöQuality is All you need for Chinese Instruction Fine-tuning

Welcome to the COIG-CQIA project page. COIG-CQIA stands for **Chinese Open Instruction Generalist - Quality is All You Need**, a high-quality Chinese instruction fine-tuning dataset. This dataset is designed to provide the Chinese NLP community with high-quality and human interaction-aligned instruction fine-tuning data.

## Project Overview

Inspired by studies like *LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment*, COIG-CQIA focuses on creating a dataset from Chinese internet sources including Q&A and articles. These are deeply cleansed, restructured, and manually reviewed to ensure quality, diversity, and relevance.

## Updates

- **[2023.12.04]** üéâ Released version 0.1 of the dataset. SFT models fully fine-tuned using v0.1 of the dataset are based on Yi-6B-base and Yi-34B-base.

## Models

Leveraging the COIG-CQIA data, we have developed a series of SFT models based on the Yi series.

| Model Name | Base Model | Download Link |
